  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Anjalai Ammal Mahalingam Engineering College (AAMEC) stands, as a beacon light in brick and mortar, men and materials, involved in learning and teaching of Technical education. It fulfils its illustrious founder and veteran railway union leader Shri.M.Namasivayam's scintillating dream and ennobling vision and to establish a temple of learning far from the maddening crowd of the cities and yet having all the facilities of a well developed urban campus imparting technical education at international standards, accessible to students from far and near, rich and poor alike.</p>

  <p>The college came into existence in August 1995. The founder desired and directed that AAMEC should be a trend setter in technical education. The Management never hesitates to spend money on the development process of the college. Money has never been a constraint to the development of the college.</p>

  <p>AAMEC has been conceived as a pace setter in the field of engineering education with noble ideas and objectives viz., “Character, Health and Education”. True to its motto, the college gives due emphasis not only on education of its students but also on character formation. Thus discipline is the watch word. The college spares efforts in moulding the students into good citizens, capable technocrats and self disciplined youth so that they are well equipped for their role as nation builders.</p>

  <p>AAMEC constantly strives for excellence. We, at AAMEC aim at ensuring that the students who bear the seal of AAMEC are capable of competing in any global context with success and distinction.</p>

  <p>The College is located in a sprawling campus of about 65 acres of land at the historic site of Kovilvenni, where King Karikala Chola defeated his enemies even as a young boy, within the limits of Thiruvarur district at a distance of just 25 kilometers from Thanjavur towards Nagapattinam. AAMEC is well served by both road & rail. The Thanjavur – Nagapattinam National Highway(NH 67) runs in front of the college and buses on this road are quite frequent. Kovilvenni railway station is located literally at the backyard of the college campus.</p>

  <p>Thanjavur occupies a proud and prominent place in the cultural map of India. The Big Temple and Saraswathi Mahal Library are internationally known cultural heritages. The handicrafts and paintings of Thanjavur are acclaimed as classics all over the world. Thanjavur is connected to Chennai, Trichy and other important places by frequent train and bus services. The nearest civil airport is at Thiruchirapalli at a distance of about 80 kilometers.</p>
